# How the Crowdsale Works
st.subheader("How Does the Crowdsale Work?")
st.write("""
The crowdsale allows companies to purchase Hyrd (HYD) tokens, which they can then use to validate and endorse job histories. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Purchasing HYD Tokens**: Participants can purchase HYD tokens at a rate of 1 HYD per unit cost, with a minimum purchase of 100 tokens. These tokens are stored in a distribution wallet managed by LinkedCHAIN.
2. **Becoming an Admin**: Entities that complete a transaction via the crowdsale are marked as admins within the ecosystem.
3. **Token Distribution**: The distribution wallet can disperse HYD tokens to individual wallets/users upon request.
4. **Validation Requests**: Users with HYD tokens can request validation of their employment records from an admin wallet(company).
5. **Admin Validation**: Admins can accept or decline validation requests. Accepted requests are added to the blockchain, ensuring the authenticity of job histories.

This system ensures a secure, efficient, and transparent process for validating professional histories.
